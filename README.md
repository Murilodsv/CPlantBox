# CPlantBox

The fastest way to try CPlantBox is to read the examples. Just uncomment the example in the main.cpp file to try, compile and run it. 

The code should compile with any c++11 compiler, e.g. for g++:
$ g++ *.cpp -std=c++11
$ ./a.out


# Folder sructure

/				CPlantBox C++ codes

# Documentation

Create the documentation by running doxygen in the folder 
$ doxygen doxy_config

The documentation should now be located in the folder /doc

To build the shared library py_rootbox for coupling with Python pleaser refer to 'python building guide.txt'
