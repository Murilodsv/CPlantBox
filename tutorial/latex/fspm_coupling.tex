\subsubsection*{Coupling a dynamic root system to DuMux with soil feedback} \label{sec:dumux_dyn_coupling}

We modify Example \ref{sec:dumux_coupling}. Using the class MappedRootSystem (as before) it is sufficient to call MappedRootSystem::simulate() to implement real root growth, i.e. to add rs.simulate(dt) in L80. The modified segments and the mapping of new segments is automatically managed (see example7b\_coupling.py). Figure \ref{fig:example7c} shows the root actual uptake over time, with a slightly altered shape compared to \ref{fig:example6c}. Note that the jumps in actual uptake are due to emerging root segments.

In this example soil state does not affect root system growth in any way. We need to add the processes we are interested in (see Section \ref{sec:tropism} and \ref{sec:functional}). For demonstration how to do that, we demonstrate the implementation steps using hydrotropim. Note that the other interactions from Section \ref{sec:functional} could be implemented in the same way. 

In order to use hydrotropism, we need to define a SoilLookUp that accesses the dynamic soil data. We present two approaches: the first uses nearest neighbour interpolation, which is fast but a coarse approximation. The second uses linear interpolation which is more exact, but slower.

We only describe the changes to Section \label{sec:dumux_coupling}:

\begin{itemize}
\item[18-25] We first create a class for nearest neighbour interpolation that extends pb.SoilLookUp. L22 stores a reference to the DuMux soil model. For specialisation of pb.SoilLookUp we need to overwrite the getValue function (L24-25). First we retrieve the cell index by calling $pick$. And, then we return the solution at this cell (in Pascal). Note that the solution is the same for each point within a cell. 
\item[28-41] Secondly, we want to use linear interpolation, which is slower, but more exact. The constructor stores a reference to the soil model (L30-34) the coordinates of the degrees of freedom (i.e. where the points where numerical solution is defined) and calls update(), which fetches the current model solution. Update will be called in after each solving step in the simulation loop. L39-L41 performs the linear interpolation. This is rather slow because the method assumes an unstructured grid, and is not optimized for a structured rectangular grid. 
\item[94-100] We set tropism to hydrotropism (L98) and modify the tropism parameters (L99,100)
\item[102,103] We set the soil, using nearest neighbour or linear interpolation.
\item[120,121] If we use linear interpolation we need to call update to copy the current solution. 
\item[122] Root system simulation, updates geometry and mappers.

\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:example7c} shows that hydrotropism will lead to increased cumulative uptake, because the roots are more evenly distributed. Note that there is a big variation in the results, and for a more profound analysis we would have to make many simulation runs.

\subsubsection*{Mimicking root growth}

For a pre-grown root architecture, root growth can be mimicked in a dynamic soil-root interactions simulation using the creation times of the root segments. The root axial conductence $k_x$ is set equal to 0 for ``unborne" root segments with negative age. The root radial conductivity, $k_r$ needs to be equal to 0 (not just a small value) for segments with negative  age. 
The parameter \lstinline{initialT} should be equal to 1 if one wants to mimic growth and equal to the final simulation time if not. 
With respect to solute transport, the diffusion coefficient needs to be very small  for unborn segments (?).
