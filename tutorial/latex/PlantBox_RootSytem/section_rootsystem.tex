\section{The RootSystem class} \label{sec:rs}

The class RootSystem is responsible for the model parameters and controls the simulation. Additionally, the class offers utility functions for post processing on a per root level, where each root is represented by a polyline, which is represented by Python list of nodes. 

Post processing functions per segment can be found in the class SegmentAnalyser (see Section \ref{sec:sa}), where a segment is part of the root represented by a line connecting two nodes.



\subsection{Initialize parameters from scratch} \label{sec:from_scratch}
 
In the previous examples we opened the root system parameters from a xml file. In this example we show how to do everything in a Python script without the need of any parameter file. This is especially important if we want to modify parameters in our scripts (e.g. like it is needed for a sensitivity analysis, see Section \ref{ssec:sensitivity}).

In order to set up a simulation by hand, we have to define all relevant model parameters. This is done by creating a RootRandomParameter object for each root type, and a SeedRandomParameter for each plant type. 

Note that during the simulation, the parameters for a specific root (RootSpecificParameter) are generated from the RootRandomParameter class which represents the random distributions of certain parameters.

\lstinputlisting[language=Python, caption=Example 2a]{../../examples/python/example2a_initializeparams.py}

\begin{itemize}

\item[11,12] Create the root type parameters of type 1 and type 2.
\item[16-38] We set up a simple root system by hand. First we define the tap root L12-L26, then the laterals L28-L38. By default all standard deviations are 0. Most parameters standard deviations can be set with an additional 's' appended to the parameter name, e.g. $lmaxs$ is the standard deviation of $lmax$, see L32
\item[40,41] Set the root type parameters.

\item[43-47] Create the seed random parameter stating when basal and shoot borne roots emerge. In this example we neglect basal adn shoot borne roots, and just define the seed location and deactivate basal roots by setting their maximal number $maxB$ to 0 ($firstB$ and $delayB$ are ignored i that case). 
\item[48] Sets the root system parameters.

\item[53] We choose the simulation times in a way that we can see the temporal development, and that all lateral roots have emerged in the final time step.

\item[54-70] Within the simulation loop we create Figure \ref{fig:ip}. L58-61 defines the limits and titles. In L63 we retrieve the roots as a polylines which is a list of roots, each root represented as list of nodes.

\item[75-80] It is not only possible to set all model parameter, 
but to retrieve the parameters after the simulation with rs.getParameter(), which returns one value per root. For all parameters that are derived from a random distribution the root specific parameter is returned (e.g. $la$, L78), i.e. the values that were drawn from the normal distribution. The root random parameter can be accessed by adding '\_mean', '\_dev' to the parameter value (e.g. $la\_mean$, L79).

\end{itemize}

Note that all parameters can be set and modified within Python. Especially, standard deviations can be set to zero in order to be able to precisely predict the result. For example we can calculate the total root system length analytically, and check if the numerical simulation yield the (exact) same result. This is performed in the tests withing test\_root.py, and test\_rootsystem, which is used to test and validate CPlantBox and formerly CRootBox.

With such simple simualtions, we can quickly check if the model does, what we expect. For exmaple the maximal number of laterals of above parameters is 16 
$= round(lmax - la - lb)/ln +  1$. We can calulate the time when the final lateral emerges as $-(lmax/r)*ln(1-(lmax-ln/2)/lmax)$ = 122.8 days. At simulation time 125 the root is 2.2 days old, and therefore approximately 4.4 cm long (initial growth rate $r_1 = 2$), which agrees with Figure \ref{fig:ip}.

\subsection{Root tropism parameters $N$ and $\sigma$} \label{ssec:tropism}

We show the influence parameters $N$ and $\sigma$ in the case of gravitropism. The parameter $N$ [1] denotes the strength of the tropism, and $\sigma$ [cm$^{-1}$] the flexibility of the root, i.e. the expected angular variation per cm root length. 

\lstinputlisting[language=Python, caption=Example 2b]{../../examples/python/example2b_tropism.py}

\begin{itemize}
\item[10-13] We choose the parameter values $N$ and $\sigma$ we want to plot. It might be interesting to change the initial insertion $angle$, and the axial resolution $dx$. Note that a change in axial resolution should not qualitatively change the resulting images.

\item[15-18] The root system is created and SeedRandomParameters are set to produce a basal root every third day. 

\item[20-23] The RootRandomParameter for tap and basal roots is defined.

\item[25-28] The loop runs over the parameters we want to modify. We create a subplot for each configuration, and start with a new root system by calling reset in L28.

\item[30-34] We set the parameters (L30,L31) and do the simulation (L33,L34)

\item[36-44] Matplotlib is used for visualization (looping over the segments is rather slow). L36 gives a list of all nodes, and L37 of all segments as two node indices. Therefore, each segment starting node n1 and end node n2, as defined in L39.

\item[L48] Creates Figure \ref{fig:tropism}.
\end{itemize}

In the first column of Figure \ref{fig:tropism} nothing happens, because if the root has no flexibility to bend ($\sigma$=0), the strength has no influence on the resulting root system. 

The first row ($N$=0) shows the influence of $\sigma$ only. The growth is undirected, because the strength of the gravitropism is zero. If the roots have small flexibility, they grow downwards because they initially do. 

The other subplots show different shapes of the root system. We normally derive the two parameters $N$ and $\sigma$ by visual comparison.

\subsection{Inter lateral spacing ($ln$, $lnk$)} \label{ssec:spacing}

A single root is divided in the basal zone, the root branching zone, and the root apical zone. Basal and apical zone are given by the parameters $la$, and $lb$ with standard deviations $la_s$ and $lb_s$. 

The root branching zone can be calculated form the maximal root length $lmax$

\subsection{Root system length over time}

The following script shows how to analyse root system length versus time. 

\lstinputlisting[language=Python, caption=Example 2d]{../../examples/python/example2d_length.py}

\begin{itemize}

\item[6] NumPy is Python's scientific computing package.
\item[7] Matplotlib is Python's easy way to create figures like in Matlab.

\item[9-14] Sets up the simulation.

\item[16-18] Defines the simulation time, time step, and the resulting number of simulate(dt) calls. 

\item[21] First we state which scalar type we want to analyse ('surface', or 'one' would also make sense).

\item[22] Pre-definition of the NumPy arrays storing the lengths over time. 

\item[23-30] The simulation loops executes the simulation for a single time step L24. L25 calculates the type of each root, L26 the length (or other scalar type) of the root. L27-L30 calculates the total root length in the time step for all roots, and for specific root types.

\item[32-38] Creates Figure \ref{fig:length}.

\end{itemize}



\subsection{Root tips and root bases}

Next we show two options how to retrieve root tip postions and root base positions from a simulation:

\lstinputlisting[language=Python, caption=Example 3b]{../../examples/python/example2e_roottips.py}

\begin{itemize}

\item[14,15] Reset the simulation and simulate for only 7 days (otherwise there are so many root tips).

\item[17-18] Outputs the number of nodes and segments to get an idea how big the resulting root system is. 
Note that number of segments equals the number of nodes minus the number of base roots that will emerge. 
Base roots are tap roots, basal roots and shootborne roots.

\item[20-36] The first approach retrieves all roots as polylines L50. 
Root tips are the last nodes of the polylines L54, root bases the first nodes L53. 
Roots that have not started to grow have only 1 node, and are not retrieved by getPolylines().

\item[28-31] Second approach: L29 rs.getNodes() returns all nodes of the root system as a list of Vector3d objects. 
Each Vector3d object can be converted into a numpy array automatically, 
but is necessary to do that for each element of the list. The methods L30, L31 return the indices of the tips and bases. 

\item[33-41] Creates Figure \ref{fig:scatter} using the second approach.

\item[44,45] Verifies that both approaches yield the same result.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sensitivity analysis} \label{ssec:sensitivity}

In the next part we vary given parameters in order to make a sensitivity analysis. This takes a lot of simulation runs and we demonstrate the of use parallel computing to speed up execution.

In this exemplary sensitivity analysis we will vary the insertion angle of the tap and basal root, and look at the resulting change in mean root tip depth and radial distance. 

\lstinputlisting[language=Python, caption=Example 2f]{../../examples/python/example2f_sensitivity.py}

\begin{itemize}

\item[12-20] Defines a function to set all standard deviations proportional to the parameter values. We use this function in the following to set the standard deviation to zero everywhere. 

\item[22-28] Parameters of the analysis. $N$ denotes the resolution of the parameter we vary, and $runs$ the number of iterations, i.e. a total of $N\cdot runs$ simulations are performed. In L29 we define the insertion angle to be varied linearly between 0 and $\pi/2$.

\item[32-51] Definition of a function that performs the simulation and returns mean root tip depth and radial distance. First we create a root system and set the standard deviation to zero L34-L36. L38, L39 sets the insertion angle. L41 initializes the root system and states that basal root are of root tape 1 (same as tap root). The False value turns of verbosity to avoid any outputs to the console. L42 performs the simulation. L44-L52 calculates the mean root tip depth and radial distance. 

\item[55-73] This section performs the computation of all simulation runs. L55-56 preallocates the resulting arrays. L62-L68 performs the parallel computations, index $i$ is the index of the insertion angle. L71-73 calculates the mean values.

\item[74-83] Creates the resulting Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity}. Note that the resulting curves become smoohter, if the number of runs is increased. (in L27)

\end{itemize}
